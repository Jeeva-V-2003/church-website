            <h2>Our Origin</h2>
            <p>The Bible Standard came into existence through the efforts of Professor Paul S. L. Johnson and Professor Raymond G. Jolly, who installed its headquarters in Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>From their studies of the Scriptures they came to the understanding that God's Plan of Salvation is far greater in scope and His mercy much more extensive than have been previously recognized.</p>
            <p>They set their goals to make this wonderful message available to as many as had a "hearing ear," and were dedicated to the accomplishment of this goal.</p>
            <p>They taught that Bible doctrine is interpreted correctly only when it is done in harmony with every other Scripture passage and teaching in the Word. Bible Standard Ministries holds to this belief today.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We are an international, nonsectarian religious Movement devoted to upholding the authenticity of the Sacred Scriptures; that they are inspired with the Holy Spirit of God and are profitable for the instruction of the Christian in righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16).</p>
            <p>It is our contention that, if the religions of today would conform their teachings to the principles set forth in the Bible, much of the moral degradation that prevails on every hand would be diminished.</p>

                <p>Paul S. L. Johnson graduated from Capital University of Columbus, Ohio with high honors. He also attended the Theological Seminary of the Ohio Synod of the Lutheran Church. Pastor Johnson was a Greek and Hebrew scholar, which in a very special way gave him the skills necessary to understand the Bible from the original languages.</p>
                <p>Although the doctrine taught in the seminary was that of eternal torment, he came to understand that a God of perfect Wisdom, Justice, Power and Love, would not nor could not punish His enemies forever. He came to see that the Bible teaching is that the punishment for sin is death, not eternal torment.</p>
